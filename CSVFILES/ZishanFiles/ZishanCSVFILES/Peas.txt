Intercropping carrots with peas is a beneficial combination for several reasons:

1. **Soil Enrichment:** Peas are nitrogen-fixing plants, meaning they can take nitrogen from the air and convert it into a usable form in the soil. Carrots, on the other hand, benefit from this additional nitrogen as it promotes healthy foliage growth.

2. **Space Utilization:** Carrots grow underground while peas grow vertically. This means they occupy different layers of the soil and don't compete for space. Intercropping allows for efficient utilization of space in the garden.

3. **Pest Management:** The scent of peas can deter certain pests that might affect carrots, thus potentially reducing pest-related issues when they are grown together.

4. **Complementary Growth:** Peas tend to fix nitrogen, which is beneficial for the soil, while carrots contribute to breaking up soil compaction with their roots. Growing them together can improve soil structure.

When intercropping carrots with peas, it's best to stagger planting and use alternate rows or patterns. Ensure adequate spacing between plants to avoid overcrowding and allow both crops to thrive without competing too much for resources.

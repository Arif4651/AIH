Intercropping lentils with sorghum can be beneficial for various reasons:

1. **Nutrient Utilization:** Sorghum and lentils have different root structures. Sorghum has deep roots that access nutrients from lower soil layers, while lentils have shallower roots. This difference in rooting depth allows for better utilization of soil nutrients at different levels.

2. **Space Utilization:** Sorghum is a tall crop, while lentils are lower-growing. This contrast in height allows for efficient utilization of space. The sorghum canopy can provide shade and help suppress weed growth, benefiting the lentil plants growing beneath.

3. **Diverse Harvest:** Intercropping provides diverse harvests. Lentils can be harvested for pulses, while sorghum can be harvested for grain, forage, or silage. This diversification can enhance food security and provide multiple end-uses.

4. **Water Use Efficiency:** Sorghum is relatively drought-tolerant and can help conserve soil moisture for both crops. Lentils, being sensitive to moisture stress, can benefit from sorghum's ability to maintain soil moisture.

When intercropping lentils with sorghum:

- **Spacing:** Proper spacing between the crops is crucial. Sorghum should be planted in rows with adequate space between them to accommodate lentils. Ensure the distance between rows and individual plants is suitable for both crops.

- **Sowing Timing:** Consider the optimal timing for sowing each crop. It's essential to synchronize their growth stages as much as possible to avoid one crop overshadowing the other.

- **Soil Fertility:** Assess the soil fertility and apply appropriate fertilizers or soil amendments to meet the requirements of both crops.

- **Varieties:** Select sorghum varieties that have an open canopy to allow light to reach the lentils growing beneath. Also, choose lentil varieties suitable for intercropping and adapted to your local conditions.

As with any intercropping practice, it's important to consider local conditions, soil types, climate, and available resources. Consulting agricultural experts or extension services for region-specific guidance can help optimize the results of intercropping lentils with sorghum.
